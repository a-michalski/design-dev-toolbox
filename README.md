# Design Dev Toolbox

A collection of developer tools for working with projects created using **Figma Make** - the automated Figma to code workflow.

## Overview

This repository contains utilities and scripts to enhance the development workflow when using Figma Make to generate React applications from Figma designs. Each tool solves specific challenges that arise when working with Figma Make projects.

## Tools

### 🎨 [Design Tokens Template](./prompts-and-guidelines/design-tokens/)

A comprehensive template and guide for implementing W3C-compliant Design Tokens systems in Figma Make projects. Provides reusable prompts, naming conventions, and best practices for maintainable theming.

**Features:**
- W3C Design Tokens Format compliance
- Two-layer architecture (primitive + semantic)
- Ready-to-use file templates
- Complete implementation checklist
- Migration guide for existing projects

## Why These Tools?

When using **Figma Make** to automatically sync Figma designs to code, you may encounter:

- **Image encoding issues**: PNG images saved as base64 strings instead of binary files
- **Export limitations**: Need to convert interactive presentations to PDF format
- **Deployment challenges**: Images not loading correctly on Vercel or other platforms

This toolbox provides solutions for these common scenarios.
